I am a theoretical astrophysicist investigating the Universe's most energetic events, particularly those taking place in the extreme environments around compact objects. My work explores how matter falls into black holes, how relativistic outflows are launched, and how these processes imprint themselves across multiple cosmic messengers. I am also deeply interested in how strong, rapidly evolving gravitational fields --such as those produced during black hole or neutron star mergers-- reshape these phenomena. To probe these scenarios, I combine semi-analytical modeling with large-scale numerical simulations.
