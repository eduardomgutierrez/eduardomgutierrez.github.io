        <p>Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are among the most energetic events in the universe, producing gravitational waves detectable by LIGO/Virgo, short gamma-ray bursts, kilonovae powered by r-process nucleosynthesis, and a variety of electromagnetic counterparts across the spectrum. The landmark detection of GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterparts opened the era of multimessenger astronomy with neutron stars.</p>

Understanding the physics of these mergers, from the inspiral dynamics to the post-merger remnant and the launching of relativistic jets, requires sophisticated numerical simulations that combine general relativity, magnetohydrodynamics, and nuclear physics.

In {% cite Gutierrez_etal2025arXiv250618995G %} and {% cite Cook_etal2025arXiv250819342C %}, we performed a systematic study of how different magnetic field configurations evolve in the post-merger remnant and surrounding accretion disk. By performing high-resolution GRMHD simulations with various initial field geometries, we identified how the magnetic field topology affects the disk structure and outflows.

In {% cite Gutierrez_etal2025PhRvD.111f3031G %}, I investigated a novel electromagnetic precursor to the main kilonova emission: the cocoon shock breakout signal. I developed a theoretical framework to predict the properties of this early-time emission, which could serve as an important target for follow-up observations of future BNS merger events.
